# CHAT_UI

A chat application's design and layout are called the Chat UI (User Interface).

These programs range from peer-to-peer messaging services like WhatsApp and Slack to online chat services like Intercom and Zendesk,
which enables live conversations between customers and corporate personnel.

Nowadays, chat clients are a common feature on most consumer-facing websites. These chat interfaces help companies get leads and handle customer complaints. 
While most chat programs largely rely on JavaScript to create the user interface, several instances of chat programs also use HTML and CSS.

Hope this helps :)
